## Installation (CocoaPods)
Configure your Podfile to use `OGCircularBar`:

```pod 'OGCircularBar'```

## Usage

Create an `OGCircularBarView` and add bars as such:

`barView.addBar(startAngle: 90, endAngle: -270, progress: 0 , radius: 100, width: 15, color: NSColor.purple, animationDuration: 0, glowOpacity: 0.4, glowRadius: 8)`

You can add static backgrounds with the following method:

`barView.addBarBackground(startAngle: 90, endAngle: -270, radius: 80, width: 10, color: NSColor.purple.withAlphaComponent(0.1))`

Animations are also supported:

`barView.bars[1].animateProgress(val, duration: 1.5)`
